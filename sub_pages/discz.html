          <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
        <p>I worked in a group of 4 where we designed an interactive interface for an emerging startup. Our group went
          through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept. We choose to redesign Discz, an
          app that helps you find your next favorite artists and songs. It's main functionality is the ability to build
          playlists at the swipe of a finger and find new music via custom recommendations catered to your taste. The
          project was split into four parts to exemplify an iterative design process flow: (1) sketching ideas of the
          interface, (2) creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a final,
          revised prototype, and (4) contacting the startup. We designed a completely different interactive solution
          that made it more intuitive and user-focused.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">User Problems</h1>
        <p>After experimenting with the app, we discovered a couple of issues that we wanted to address in our
          redesigned vision of the Discz music app.
        </p>
        <ul class="left_text">
          <li>No confirmation that the user swiped left or right </li>
          <li> The navigation bar was confusing to use </li>
          <li> Unable to discover new music based on genre</li>
          <li>Can not edit songs and albums once added to profile page</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Start Up</h1>
        <p>Discz is a Y-combinator startup that was founded in 2021 by Bobby Pinckney and Michelle Yin. Discz joined
          Y-combinator in the winter of 2022 to bring their idea of discoing new music to more people. Since launching
          in March, Discz ranked in the top 10 apps in the App Store music charts with over 300,000 monthly active users
          and 3 million song saves per week. The core concept behind Discz is that it is a Spotify-integrated music
          discovery platform built to help you find your next favorite artists and songs. It's main functionality is the
          ability to build playlists at the swipe of a finger and find new music via custom recommendations catered to
          your taste! You can swipe through song snippets to find music you love and add it to your spotify playlists.

          <h1>Design Iterations</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Low Fidelity Mock-ups</h1>
        <p>Each of us chose to independently work on lofi designs for what discz should be like. Thus, at the end, we
          had four distinct designs. The four designs were based off of current apps that were also similar to Discz:
          TikTok, Pandora, Netflix, and Spotify. The following wireframes were designed in Balsamiq.</p>
        <p>After discussing why we made specific design choices, we combined all the ideas that we thought were good and
          create a new simplified and sleek design for Discz. In our lofi/higi designs, worked on three major navigation
          tabs: Discover, Playlist, and Profile. </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Hi Fidelity Mock-ups</h1>
        <p>The final high fidelity mock-up was developed in Figma and allowed us to figure out which details we wanted
          to implement and which to leave out.</p>
        <p>One of the largest changes that was made was the color scheme and logo of Discz. We thought that the color
          palette of the original logo was too graphic and detailed. Thus, we went for more of a minimalist look and
          simplified colors to be teal, black and white. We kept the overall logo shape, but made it 2D and
          minimalistic. </p>

        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Student Critiques</h1>

        <p>We gathered student critiques on our initial design and made changes to inform out finalized hifi prototype.
          Below are some of the critiques that we recieved.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Positive Critiques</h1>
        <div class="left_text">
          <ul>
            <li>Likes the hierarchy of it, especially with the album covers.</li>
            <li>Like the general layout and big album pictures. </li>
            <li>Bottom bar is a different color, that's cool. It helps keep track of what page you're on.</li>
            <li>Likes the navigation, it works well</li>
            <li>Likes transition between pages. </li>
            <li>Like the hierarchy and transitional animations</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Constructive Critiques</h1>
        <div class="left_text">
          <ul>
            <li>Not sure what create button supposed to be doing since it links back to Discover. Should go to a Create
              page?</li>
            <li>Text is kind of small (describing the genres), but the big pictures are good. </li>
            <li>Intuition is to add the songs directly from the libraries, so when he sees the playlists he didn't find
              the discover button at the bottom, so was looking for the plus sign in the libraries page.</li>
            <li>Discover and the playlists are too similar of a format to distinguish bewteen the two</li>
            <li>Recommendations and recent listening are within the settings option of the app, it's a bit unintuitive.
            </li>
            <li>Confused why the recommendations have a plus or minus on the settings screen, though the recommendations
              were all the songs you haven't listened to.</li>
            <li>Didn't expect the discover to go into a song, thought it would go to a playlist</li>
            <li>For the discovery page, the search should be on the outside.</li>
            <li>confused about the mental model of when we're swiping on the tracks, does skipping it also mean liking
              or disliking? Because skipping goes to the right and left.</li>
            <li>plus icon on the Discover page is counterintuitive. It would be more clear if it was like “Explore more
              music” or something</li>
            <li>Confused about the cancel button in the player screen (the X)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">User Testing</h1>
        <p>We used anonymous users to test the UX design from our Figma design by utilizing the online resource
          UserTesting. UX designers can upload their projects to this platform and anonymous individuals around the
          world can complete a series of tasks defined by us. Our team used UserTesting in order to test our final
          version of the high fidelity Figma mock-up and were reviewed by four individuals. They were given four tasks
          to complete and asked a series of questions about our design and also give additional feedback. After each
          user tested out design, each of their experiences were screen recorded and shared back to us.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Testing tasks & Questions</h1>
        <div class="left_text">
          <ol>
            <li>Select a radio in the Discover page and swipe through songs. The only radio that is currently
              interactable is the K-pop radio.</li>
            <li>Create a new radio and add a minimum of two songs.</li>
            <li>View the first playlist on the Library page.</li>
            <li>View your profile and view the edit profile page.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>We also included questions to describe their experience navigating through each page and whether it was easy
          or difficult to understand. </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Testing Results</h1>
        <p>From the feedback from out UserTesting users, we found that majority of the users had an overall positive
          experience with our newly redesigned app. They found it to be intuitive and was clear how to navigate to the
          correct objective. Some users had issue with the swiping functionality mainly because it was in a Figma mockup
          and was hard to simulate swiping action on a computer. We had an average intuitively score of 4.5 among all
          three pages. </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Through this project, I learned how important creating an intuitive website is for users to understand how to
          use a platform and for developers to get their message across. A project should be able to help the user
          navigate to their desired goal without too much confusion or excessive clicking around. It is the job of the
          developer to help direct the user to seemly use the platform.
