          <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
        <p> In this project, I am redesigning a website in order to improve the user experience (UX). This means making
          the website more user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to navigate. I will need to conduct research on the target
          audience for the website, and analyze the current design in order to identify areas for improvement. The focus
          of the redesign should be on enhancing the user's interaction with the website, and making it easy for them to
          find what they are looking for. Once I have developed a new design, I will need to present my ideas and
          receive feedback in order to refine and improve my design. The final product should be a website that
          effectively meets the needs of the target audience, and provides a smooth and enjoyable user experience. I
          analyzed and identified flaws in an existing interface, create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for
          various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
        <p>I analyzed the usability of the web page using design criteria including usability (e.g., including
          efficiency), learnability, and memorability. In addition utilizing the three usability guidelines to analyze
          the website, I also used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems.</p>

          <h1>Research</h1>
        </div>
        <p>I chose the arXiv website because it is a commonly used website where a lot of researchers use it to post
          both pre-published and published papers. Because researchers are notorious for being utilitarian, the design
          and layout of this website lacks a good user interface. Futhermore, this design is the original design that
          was used in 1980s. Thus, it needs a good makeover. Below is an images of the WAVE report.

        <div class="step-text">
          <ul>
            <li>There are 3 errors, which consist of an empty link and 2 broken ARIA items. The fact that a link is
              empty may be misleading and a broken ARIA item prevents web applications from being accessible to people
              with disabilities. I would have never known of these errors if I did not use WAVE. </li>
            <li>There are no contrast errors so the website uses a great color scheme and all the font sizes are
              accessible. </li>
            <li>No way to have search results show up based on preference (date, author, number of times cited, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>No quick way to gather information from results (ie. if you only want to see how many related papers
              there are, you have to step through severl pages to get there, no quick access button)</li>
            <li>Hard to know which filters someone is using</li>
            <li>Lots of text overwhelming the user all at once</li>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Lofi designs</h1>
        <p>For my lofi designs, I decided to entirely rework the website. Instead of having a bunch of hyperlinks that
          you have to step through, there is now a search bar and filter that allows a user to get more refined results.
          In this way, the website is more oriented to a query search as opposed to a catalog search. When in tablet or
          phone sizes, the website squishes the filtered search into an icon at the top right.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Visual Design Style Guide</h1>
        <p>For my visual design style guide, I used the website's original colors of white, black and red so that people
          can recoginze that this is the same website. I chose these colors because they contrasted eachother very well:
          the black and the white with a pop of red color. I also made two types of search results depending on which
          device someone is using. I used icons when the device is small because I wanted to minimalize the amount of
          text.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h1>
        <p>One of the biggest takeaways from this project was the importance of conducting thorough research on the
          target audience for the website. By understanding the needs and preferences of the users, I was able to design
          a website that was much more tailored to their specific requirements. Additionally, I was able to identify
          areas of the current design that were causing frustration or confusion for users, and incorporate solutions to
          these problems into my new design.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Lessons learned</h1>
        <p>Through this project, I learned how creating an accessible and dynamic website is both challenging and
          rewarding. A website should be able to help the user navigate to their desired goal without too much confusion
          or excessive clicking around. As seen here, I restructured the arXiv website to be less folder oriented and
          more search oriented. Finally, I also made the website viable in different screen settings, allowing people
          with different devices to easily access the same information. </p>
        <p>One surprising idea that came out of this project was the use of gamification to engage and motivate users.
          By incorporating elements of game design, such as points, rewards, and challenges, into the website, I was
          able to create a more interactive and enjoyable user experience. This approach was well received by the target
          audience, and significantly increased user engagement and satisfaction with the website.
