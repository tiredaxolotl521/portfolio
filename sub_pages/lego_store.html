                </div>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
                <p>The goal of the application is to allow users to sort through lego products and add lego products to
                    their cart. Users can browse through an assorted variety of lego products and pick one based on
                    their desired interests. The value of the application is to have an easy on-stop-shop interface for
                    users to filter through lego products.
                </p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Why React?</h1>
                <p>This project uses React as its main development tool because it allows developers to quickly build
                    responsive designs efficiently. React allows users to create components that can be reused
                    throughout the program, which makes it very dynamic and responsive. In our case, we have multiple of
                    the same components like my lego items and cart items that can be reuse in this react app. </p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="content">
                <div class="content_title">
                    <h1>Research</h1>
                </div>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Usability Principles Considered</h1>
                <p>I implemented various sort and filter options that proves to be most beneficial to the users. I chose
                    sorting based on: <b>Rating, Price #Minifigures, #Pieces, Age and Name</b>. I also had options for
                    users to
                    filter by model type as well as availability and whether or not the model was <b>exclusive, hard to
                        fine or easy to find</b>. For general users, this website allows people to easily sort through a
                    lego
                    database to find exactly what they want and determine if it is available to buy now. For the more
                    serious lego buyers, they are able to find specific information about each set like the number of
                    minifigures or the total number of pieces to determine if the set is worth their money. All of these
                    details can be filtered by the user. Once the user is ready to buy their legos, multiple sets can be
                    added to the cart to then checkout. Cart items can be increased or decreased as well for any last
                    minute changes. Users read the website from left to right, then top to bottom where all the filters
                    are on the right, the items places in the middle and finally the checkout cart on the way right.
                    Thus, the user can view all the major components at once.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Organization of Component</h1>
                <p>There are two components in this React app (<b>LegoItem</b> and <b>CartItem</b>)</p>
                <p><b>LegoItem</b> represents the component for every lego set card displayed on the page. The LegoItem
                    card displays data like the name of each set, number of minifigures, number of pieces, age,
                    availability, type of set and type of model. In each card, there is also an <b>add to cart</b>
                    button that adds each individual item to the cart for checkout.
                </p>
                <p><b>CartItem</b> represents the component for each type of lego set that is added to the cart. A
                    CartItem is only displayed when the user clicks the <b>add to cart</b> button in the lego card and
                    is added to the cart. This component contains data like the name of the item, the price of the item,
                    an image of the item, the counts for the number of items in the cart and two buttons to add or
                    remove more of the same item into the cart.
                </p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h1>
                <p>I have one JSON file that contains data on all the lego attributes. This fill includes information
                    about each of the 26 lego items. Each item includes data on the name, rating, price, pieces, age,
                    #minifigures, model_type availability, type, and an image link. This information is passed in to the
                    LegoItem component so that it can be displayed. This data is also passed into the sort and filter
                    functions so that the program knows which fields it can sort/filter on.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">How the User Triggers State Changes</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Sorting</h3>
                        <p>I used 2 sorting states called sortBy and sortLego to get sorting functionality to work. The
                            sortLego constant holds all the newly sorted lego cards depending on which type of sorting
                            the user selects. This constant is updated by the filterChanger function where all the cards
                            on the page are sorted with the .sort function. Sorting is either acceding, descending or
                            alphabetical depending on which sorting option the user selects. If the user selects price
                            or age, the sorting occurs acceding. If the user selects rating, pieces or minifigures, the
                            sorting occurs descending. Finally if they sort by name, sorting occurs alphabetically. The
                            sortBy constant represents the category which the program is sorting by.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Filters</h3>
                        <p>
                            For each type of filter, there are states associated with each filter. In my program, I have
                            3 different dictionaries that sort by model type, set type and available. Each of these 3
                            dictionaries have their own independent filters. When the user choses a filter states, the
                            program is called to update the states of the checked filters. This triggers the Lego cards
                            to be displayed that correlate with the filters that the user checked. At the beginning of
                            the program, all filters are initially checked. The user then unselects filters to chose
                            specific types.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Cart and Total</h3>
                        <p>
                            There is a constant that represents a tuple that holds both a dictionary and a total price
                            called cart. The dictionary to holds the state of the cart with information on the type of
                            items and how many of each item are included in the cart. Once the user selects an item they
                            want, they can add it to the cart. This functionality is a result of the updateCart function
                            that updates the number of items in the cart to include the item name and its count. The
                            cart is also updated if the user clicks on the plus or minus buttons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In parallel, the total price in the cart in increased when a user adds an additional item to
                            the cart. When the user clicks the "Add to cart" button, the total price of the cart is
                            similarly updated by the updateCart function. This functionality also extends to the plus
                            and minus buttons with the addItem and removeItem function. The total is updated as a result
                            and keeps track of the aggregate cost.

                <p>This is a low fidelity mock-up that was used to design the overall structure of the React web app. As
                    show, the app is divided into three main sections. One where you can filter and sort by different
                    categories One large middle section that displays all the data and item cards. Finally, one section
                    on the way right where you can see the items that you bought and how much they cost. These cards
                    that are shown in the middle of the application can dynamically change based on the filters and
                    sorting selected by the users. </p>

                <p>These are my high fidelity mock-up for the filters and sorting options as well as the cart. The
                    filtering and sorting options sit on the left hand side of the page. The sorting option is in the
                    form of radio buttons where the user can only select one at a time as seen in the first image. The
                    next three images are different type of filters: model type, availability and set type. The user can
                    select as many different combinations of these filters to narrow down their result. There is also a
                    rest filter button that brings the user to the default settings.
                </p>
                <p>In the right hand side of the page house the cart. Here, the cart holds information about how many
                    items are in the cart and an increment/decrement button to add/remove items. There is also a clear
                    cart button just in case the user does not want to buy anything. Once the user is finished finding
                    their items, they can hit the checkout button to finish their purchase.

                <p>Through this project, I learned the importance of having a responsive website and the power of
                    components. By making a website utilizing polymorphism, we can dynamically sort, filter and add
                    components extremely easily. Furthermore, I learned how to use react builtin components to make a
                    clean website that was well structured. I now have a better understanding of how to choose
                    components that would best align with a desired functionality.</p>
