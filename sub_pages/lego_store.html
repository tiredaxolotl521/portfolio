                <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
                <p>The goal of the application is to allow users to sort through lego products and add lego products to
                    their cart. Users can browse through an assorted variety of lego products and pick one based on
                    their desired interests. This LEGO website provides users with a user-friendly and intuitive
                    interface for browsing, filtering, and sorting through a collection of LEGO item information. With
                    this website, users will be able to quickly and easily find the specific LEGO items they are looking
                    for, using various filters and sorting options to narrow down the available options and view only
                    the items that meet their specific criteria. Additionally, this website may also provide users with
                    additional information about each LEGO item, such as its price, availability, and other details, to
                    help them make informed decisions when making their purchases.
                </p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Why React?</h1>
                <p>This project uses React as its main development tool because it allows developers to quickly build
                    responsive designs efficiently. React allows users to create components that can be reused
                    throughout the program, which makes it very dynamic and responsive. In our case, we have multiple of
                    the same components like my lego items and cart items that can be reuse in this react app. </p>

                </div>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Usability Principles Considered</h1>
                <p>I implemented various sort and filter options that proves to be most beneficial to the users. I chose
                    sorting based on: <b>Rating, Price #Minifigures, #Pieces, Age and Name</b>. I also had options for
                    users to
                    filter by model type as well as availability and whether or not the model was <b>exclusive, hard to
                        fine or easy to find</b>. For general users, this website allows people to easily sort through a
                    lego
                    database to find exactly what they want and determine if it is available to buy now. For the more
                    serious lego buyers, they are able to find specific information about each set like the number of
                    minifigures or the total number of pieces to determine if the set is worth their money. All of these
                    details can be filtered by the user. Once the user is ready to buy their legos, multiple sets can be
                    added to the cart to then checkout. Cart items can be increased or decreased as well for any last
                    minute changes. Users read the website from left to right, then top to bottom where all the filters
                    are on the right, the items places in the middle and finally the checkout cart on the way right.
                    Thus, the user can view all the major components at once.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h1>
                <p>I have one JSON file that contains data on all the lego attributes. This fill includes information
                    about each of the 26 lego items. Each item includes data on the name, rating, price, pieces, age,
                    #minifigures, model_type availability, type, and an image link. This information is passed in to the
                    LegoItem component so that it can be displayed. This data is also passed into the sort and filter
                    functions so that the program knows which fields it can sort/filter on.</p>

                <p>This is a low fidelity mock-up that was used to design the overall structure of the React web app. As
                    show, the app is divided into three main sections. One where you can filter and sort by different
                    categories One large middle section that displays all the data and item cards. Finally, one section
                    on the way right where you can see the items that you bought and how much they cost. These cards
                    that are shown in the middle of the application can dynamically change based on the filters and
                    sorting selected by the users. </p>

                <h1 class="subtitle">Hifi Designs</h1>
                <p>These are my high fidelity mock-up for the filters and sorting options as well as the cart. The
                    filtering and sorting options sit on the left hand side of the page. The sorting option is in the
                    form of radio buttons where the user can only select one at a time as seen in the first image. The
                    next three images are different type of filters: model type, availability and set type. The user can
                    select as many different combinations of these filters to narrow down their result. There is also a
                    rest filter button that brings the user to the default settings.
                </p>
                <p>In the right hand side of the page house the cart. Here, the cart holds information about how many
                    items are in the cart and an increment/decrement button to add/remove items. There is also a clear
                    cart button just in case the user does not want to buy anything. Once the user is finished finding
                    their items, they can hit the checkout button to finish their purchase.

                <h1 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h1>
                <p>Through this project, I learned the importance of having a responsive website and the power of
                    components. By making a website utilizing polymorphism, we can dynamically sort, filter and add
                    components extremely easily. Furthermore, I learned how to use react builtin components to make a
                    clean website that was well structured. I now have a better understanding of how to choose
                    components that would best align with a desired functionality.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Lessons learned</h1>
                <p>One lesson that can be learned from creating a React app that sorts and filters through Lego data is
                    the importance of modularity and code reusability. By breaking the application into smaller,
                    self-contained components, it becomes easier to manage and maintain the codebase over time. A
                    surprising idea that could potentially be generated from this app is the use of machine learning
                    algorithms to automatically sort and categorize the Lego data based on various factors such as
                    color, shape, and size. This could provide an even more powerful and intuitive way for users to
                    interact with the data and discover new patterns and insights.</p>
