          <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
        <p>The objective of this project is to observe real users interacting with an interface of my choosing and
          create personas based on user experiences. I chose to observe people using the Yo-Kai express machine in the
          RISD portfolio dinning hall. From my interviews and observations, I was able to create personas and develop a
          storyboard.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Contextual inquiry</h1>
        <p>Contextual inquiry is a type of field study that involves in-depth observation and interviews of a small
          sample of users to gain a robust understanding of work practices and behaviors. For this project, I observed
          and interview people while they were interacting with an interface. I selected an interface in public view and
          observed others that would not make them uncomfortable. For this assingment, I chose to write about the Yokai
          hot soup machine in the RISD portfolio dining hall.

        <div class="page_img">
          <img src="../images/yokai.png">
        </div>
        <p>The accessible interface I choose was the YoKai hot noodle soup machine located in the RISD portfolio dining
          hall. I choose this machine because it is a complex mechanism, but has a sleek user interface and I wanted to
          see how RISD students interacted with this unique machine.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">User experience</h1>
        <p>I selected interface in public view so that other members of the public may see what's going on. I prepared
          questions for users regarding their experiences with the interface that solicited insight about their
          expectations, experience, motives, and challenges using the interface. Then I created a sketch and briefly
          explain the problem that the interface is trying to solve and how its key components function.
        </p>
        <p>I observed about 5 different people using the Yo-Kai Express machine. I particularly focused on how they used
          the interface and if there were any struggles or difficulties users encountered. After watching several
          people,
          I wrote two things in my notebook.

        <div class="left_text">
          <ol>
            <li>Notes describing the key observations from observing users. This is essentially an accumulation of
              general patterns of interactions with the interface.
            </li>
            <li>List of questions and summarized responses from users that highlighted the main points or important
              patterns.

        <h1 class="subtitle">Empathy Maps</h1>
        <p>I then took the data gathered from the observations and interviews from users and created a persona. These
          personas are in the form of empathy maps of based on general trends and overarching characteristics I observe
          in the users I interviewed.</p>

        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Story Board</h1>
        <p>To create storyboard, I used one of the personas from the empathy maps to develop a scenario where a user
          would normally use this interface. The storyboard aim is to present authenticity, emotion, and simplicity.
          The storyboard created follows my persona's journey from start to end of how they use the Yo-Kai express
          machine. The storyboards represents the goals of the user and illustrates the steps for using the interface.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h1>
        <p>Through this project, I had several key takeaways. First, personas are fictional characters that represent
          the different types of users who will be interacting with the product. By creating personas, designers can
          gain a deeper understanding of their users' needs, goals, and motivations, which can help guide the design
          process and ensure that the final product meets the needs of the target audience. Additionally, personas can
          help designers avoid making assumptions about their users, which can lead to design decisions that may not be
          effective or user-friendly. Overall, creating personas is a crucial step in the UI/UX design process, as it
          allows designers to create products that are tailored to the needs of their users.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Lessons learned</h1>
        <p>Creating personas is valuable for understanding user interaction in a UI/UX project. It's important to
          conduct thorough research and actively use personas during the design process. Personas can also encourage
          empathy and understanding.</p>
        <p>One surprising idea that emerged during the project was the idea of using personas as a way to encourage
          empathy and understanding. By assigning characteristics and personalities to each persona, I was able to see
          the project from the perspective of the end user and make design decisions that would improve their
          experience.</p>
