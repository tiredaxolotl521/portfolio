          <h1>Problem</h1>
        </div>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
        <p>The objective of this project is to observe real users interacting with an interface of my choosing and
          create personas based on user experiences. I chose to observe people using the Yo-Kai express machine in the
          RISD portfolio dinning hall. From my interviews and observations, I was able to create personas and develop a
          storyboard.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Contextual inquiry</h1>
        <p>Contextual inquiry is a type of field study that involves in-depth observation and interviews of a small
          sample of users to gain a robust understanding of work practices and behaviors. For this project, I observed
          and interview people while they were interacting with an interface. I selected an interface in public view and
          observed others that would not make them uncomfortable. For this assingment, I chose to write about the Yokai
          hot soup machine in the RISD portfolio dining hall.

        <div class="page_img">
          <img src="../images/yokai.png">
        </div>
        <p>The accessible interface I choose was the YoKai hot noodle soup machine located in the RISD portfolio dining
          hall. I choose this machine because it is a complex mechanism, but has a sleek user interface and I wanted to
          see how RISD students interacted with this unique machine.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Description of interface</h1>
        <p>The Yokai machine serves different types of hot ramen in 45 seconds. The problem the interface is trying to
          solve is the ability to order and receive hot food within seconds. Through this interactive interface, users
          are able to select a variety of bowls and payment options to have a hot meal delivered in 45 seconds. A major
          key component of the interface is the large touchscreen on the left hand side. This screen provides the main
          functionality where users can order items and select their payment type. To use the device, a user must accept
          terms and agreements before scrolling through a list of different types of bowls they can order. Once a user
          finds a bowl they like, the user can select the bowl to get more information (ie. ingredients and allergies).
          Finally, the user can select their preferred method of payment and wait for their order to arrive. This
          process usually takes up to 45 seconds.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">User experience</h1>
        <p>I selected interface in public view so that other members of the public may see what's going on. I prepared
          questions for users regarding their experiences with the interface that solicited insight about their
          expectations, experience, motives, and challenges using the interface. Then I created a sketch and briefly
          explain the problem that the interface is trying to solve and how its key components function.
        </p>
        <p>I observed about 5 different people using the Yo-Kai Express machine. I particularly focused on how they used
          the interface and if there were any struggles or difficulties users encountered. After watching several
          people,
          I wrote two things in my notebook.
        </p>
        <div class="left_text">

              general patterns of interactions with the interface.

        <h1 class="subtitle">Empathy Maps</h1>
        <p>I then took the data gathered from the observations and interviews from users and created a persona. These
          personas are in the form of empathy maps of based on general trends and overarching characteristics I observe
          in the users I interviewed.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Story Board</h1>
        <p>To create storyboard, I used one of the personas from the empathy maps to develop a scenario where a user
          would normally use this interface. The storyboard aim is to present authenticity, emotion, and simplicity.
          The storyboard created follows my persona's journey from start to end of how they use the Yo-Kai express
          machine. The storyboards represents the goals of the user and illustrates the steps for using the interface.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This project taught me the importance of user researcher and learning from objective observations. By
          observing users use an interface, I could truly understand what the pain points were in using the Yo-Kai
          express machine. As a result, I could generalize users into different personas and better understand how they
          use the machine. I can apply this knowledge to future projects where user testing is imperative to the success
          of a product.</p>
